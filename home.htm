  <li>Your life, as it builds problem solving ability in you.</li></h4>
        <h4><li>Development internships in dream companies like Google, Microsoft, etc.</li></h4>
      <h4><li>Development jobs in dream companies like Amazon, Facebook, etc.</li></h4>

    <h3> <u> How will Competitive Programming benefit you in your Career?</u></h3>
    <ul style="background-color: #121212;">
      <h4><li>You can very well use your ratings [achieved on various competitive programming platforms]<br> on your resume to show how you outstand amongst your colleagues!<br> (Believe it or not, recruiters do get impressed by seeing your performance on online platforms).</h4>
      <h4><li> will learn how to approach a problem with the best of the best possible ways,<br> you will learn how to analytically think and solve a problem and analyze it’s space and time complexity.</h4>
      <h4><li>Every large MNC or Product-based company prefers to have initial filtering round <br> consists of Competitive Programming problems.</h4>
      <h4><li>You will get to learn a programming language end to end.</h4>
      <h4><li>The adrenaline rush that you will get after seeing the green tick<br> and your name on the leaderboard - there’s nothing compared to that.</h4>

      <h3 style=color:#E95065 ;>Step 1: CHOSING LANGUAGE</h3><ul style="background-color: #121212;">
        <h4><li>You can do competitive programming in any programming language <br>but it is highly recommended that you choose one of C/C++ or Java.<br> The reason being that the time of execution is a key factor in Competitive Programming <br>and so, choosing a language whose time of execution is fast is surely going to give you a benefit.<br> C/C++ and Java are relatively faster, particularly when compared to languages like Python.</h4></li>

      <h4><li>It’s better to use C++ because it’s among the fastest in terms of execution time and it provides a lot of inbuilt functionalities,<br> is most widely used and has support for various data structures through STL (Standard template library),<br> however, Java is also a good choice as it supports BigInteger<br> (the ability to store large numbers without the overflow problems).</h4></li>

        <h4><li>If you are a total beginner to programming, it is highly recommended that you learn a programming language.<br></li></h4><br></ul></div>
